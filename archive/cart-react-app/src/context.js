The reducer function handles the updates to the state based on the dispatched actions.

// ---> So, any component that needs to access the state or modify the state can simply import the useGlobalContext hook from this file, and then call the required properties or functions from the useGlobalContext() return value. This way, the component can access or modify the state, without having to pass props down the component tree.

// ---> he useReducer hook is a built-in hook provided by React that allows you to manage state with a reducer function.

// In the provided code, useReducer is used to manage the state of the AppContext using the reducer function and the initialState object.
// The useReducer hook takes two arguments:
// The reducer function: This function specifies how the state should be updated based on the actions that are dispatched to it. The reducer function takes two arguments: the state and the action. The state argument represents the current state of the application, and the action argument represents the action that is being dispatched to update the state.
// The initialState object: This object specifies the initial state of the application.
// The useReducer hook returns an array with two values:
// The state value: This is the current state of the application.
// The dispatch function: This function is used to dispatch actions to the reducer, which in turn updates the state.
